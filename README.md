# Crown Court Digital Case System Keyboard Shortcuts Script

## About
CCDCS has no keyboard shortcuts. I wrote a bit of javascript to add them. You will need a script manager such as [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) installed in your browser.

## Disclaimer
I have **only** tested this on my laptop (Windows, UK keyboard). I have no idea if it will work properly on yours (Macs, other keyboard layouts). I am not responsible for anything that goes wrong.

## Installation
Please install the appropriate script via my GreasyFork page: https://greasyfork.org/en/users/1107168-edmundpotts

If you don't have a script manager installed already (see above) then it should prompt you and help with that.
